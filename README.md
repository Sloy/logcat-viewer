# Logcat Viewer
My very first attempt at an Electron app (WIP).

This is a simple macOS application that displays and formats logcat output in a nice way.

It's an unfinished product and under development, check out the [Issues](https://github.com/Sloy/logcat-viewer/issues) section and feel free to contribute.
